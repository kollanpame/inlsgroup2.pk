    <h1>Blobfish (Psychrolutes marcidus)</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The blobfish is a deep-sea fish that lives off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand. 
        It inhabits depths of 600 to 1,200 meters (2,000 to 3,900 feet) where the pressure is 
        60 to 120 times greater than at sea level.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
        The blobfish has a gelatinous body with very little muscle mass. Its body is slightly 
        less dense than water, which allows it to float above the sea floor without expending 
        much energy. At depth, the blobfish looks like a normal fish, but when brought to the 
        surface, the rapid pressure change causes its body to expand and take on its famous 
        "blob-like" appearance.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Habitat and Diet</h2>
    <p>
        Blobfish live in the deep waters of the Pacific Ocean. They feed on small crustaceans, 
        mollusks, and other organic matter that floats by. Due to the scarcity of food at such 
        depths, blobfish have evolved to conserve energy by remaining relatively stationary.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
    <p>
        The blobfish is considered vulnerable due to deep-sea trawling activities that 
        accidentally catch them as bycatch. Their slow reproduction rate and specialized 
        habitat make them particularly susceptible to population decline.
